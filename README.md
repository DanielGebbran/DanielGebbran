- Hi, I’m Daniel Gebbran (@DanielGebbran over here). For more details on my background, please check my LinkedIn and Google Scholar pages! 
- I currently am the Senior Manager of Energy Portfolio and Asset Optimization in Equilibrium Energy, working with great scientists and software developers, and coordinating work within the team and across teams to ensure the development of algorithms for interfacing optimization of energy resources with energy markets under practical considerations for real-world deployment.
- I’m interested in collaborations, or even discussing, the application of optimization algorithms into energy operations reasearch and intelligent energy systems. 
- In particular, models geared towards the higher penetration of renewables in the grid, and the use of battery resources as flexible energy suppliers.
- However, other broad topics where applied maths meet engineering and code development nearly always piques my interest!
- I’m currently collaborating on academic projects with Brazilian and German universities, and have collaborated with US, Australian and Danish universities as well.
- How to reach me: I am very active on LinkedIn, so feel free to reach me there.
